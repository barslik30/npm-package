how to install?
npm install json_functions

or
npm i json_functions

Why should I use this package?
This package simapling many things as:

just writing the name of the json
read("jsonExample")

and its read all the json in one command.

Creating new json with easy template
write(jsonName,id,firstname,lastname,address) 
That gives nice template with array
[
        id,{
        "First name":firstname,
        "Last name":lastname,
        "Address":address
        }]
